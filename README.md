This is a Python data analysis project created using **"Jupyter Notebook"**

I used a **CSV file** as the primary data source to perform various data analysis tasks such as data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

**Resources Used:**

CSV dataset (included in the project)
Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis)
Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
